Feature: As a Visitor.
  In order to know when my order is ready for pick-up.
  After clicking buy now, I would like to see an order confirmation with estimated pick up time.

  Background:
    Given I have a dish in my order and I am on the checkout_screen

  Scenario: Visitor clicks Buy now! and is taken to a order confirmation page with pick-up time.
    When I click "Buy now!"
    Then I should be on the order confirmation page
    And I should see "Thank you for your order! Your food will be ready for pick up at"
    And I should see a pick up time 30 minutes from now
